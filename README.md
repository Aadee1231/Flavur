# Flavur  
### The Future of Food

Flavur is an AI-native food platform reimagining how people discover, plan, and experience plant-based food.

Built for a generation that expects personalization, intelligence, and creator-driven ecosystems — not static recipes.

---

## Vision

Food is one of the most repeated decisions humans make — yet the tools around it haven’t evolved.

Flavur exists to fix that.

We are building the intelligent layer between people, food creators, and everyday decision-making — powered by AI, designed for scale.

## What Flavur Does

Flavur helps users:
- Discover high-quality vegetarian & vegan recipes
- Instantly generate weekly meal plans tailored to them
- Reduce food waste through ingredient-aware planning
- Import recipes from the internet and social platforms
- Support creators directly inside the platform

All through a seamless, AI-first experience.

---

## Why It Matters

- Food decisions happen **daily**
- Meal planning is **cognitively expensive**
- Existing tools are **static, manual, and fragmented**

Flavur turns food planning into a smart, adaptive system — not a checklist.
